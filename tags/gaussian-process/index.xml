Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe public health consequences in the United States. The United States began a vaccination campaign at the end of 2020 targeting primarily elderly residents before extending access to younger individuals. With both COVID-19 infection fatality ratios and vaccine uptake being heterogeneous across ages, an important consideration is whether the age contribution to deaths shifted over time towards younger age groups.</description>
