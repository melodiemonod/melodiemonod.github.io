title: "About me"
---

I studied Economics and Statistics at the University of Geneva (2015-18) as an undergrad and went on to obtain an MSc in Statistics at Imperial College London (2019). My MSc dissertation focussed on developing statistical models and efficient algorithms to reconstruct epidemic transmission chains from deep sequence data.
I am now doing a PhD within the CDT in Modern Statistics and Statistical Machine Learning between Imperial and Oxford. I remain interested in statistical modelling, computational methods and stochastic processes with applications in the bio-medical sciences. I also have a growing interest in Bayesian statistics.
