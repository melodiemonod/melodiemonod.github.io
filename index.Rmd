I studied Economics and Statistics at the [University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/gsem/en/programs/bachelor/description/) (2015-18) as an undergrad and went on to obtain an MSc in Statistics at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/statistics) (2019). My MSc dissertation focused on developing statistical models and efficient algorithms to reconstruct epidemic transmission chains from deep sequence data. I am currently part of the [CDT in Modern Statistics and Statistical Machine Learning](https://statml.io/) between Imperial and Oxford.

My research focus on modeling infectious disease's transmission and the use of efficient computational methods for inference.
